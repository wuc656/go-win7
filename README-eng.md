# Patched Go SDK for Windows 7

The Go SDK with patches that can run on Windows 7. Only reverted some commits that will break running on Windows 7 from [Go](https://github.com/golang/go).

This SDK is used for building binaries that can run on Windows 7 that does not supported officially by Go now. You can use it freely to build binaries targeting Windows 7 from Go.

If you need other pre-built SDK binaries that does not found in Release, you may fork and build it.

## Status

Currently found these changes in Go SDK will stop running Windows 7:

- `a17d959debdb04cd550016a3501dd09d50cd62e7` (`runtime: always use LoadLibraryEx to load system libraries`) (affecting older builds, details in below section)
- `7c1157f9544922e96945196b47b95664b1e39108` (`net: remove sysSocket fallback for Windows 7`)
- `48042aa09c2f878c4faa576948b07fe625c4707a` (`syscall: remove Windows 7 console handle workaround`)
- `693def151adff1af707d82d28f55dba81ceb08e1` (`crypto/rand,runtime: switch RtlGenRandom for ProcessPrng`)
- `534d6a1a9c81b25bdad1052e736b2f072caa3903` (`crypto/rand: prevent Read argument from escaping to heap`) (breaking previous patch on `crypto/rand,runtime: switch RtlGenRandom for ProcessPrng`)

### Testing environment

All running tests are under manual operation due to there are no runners based on Windows 7 and Windows 8 in Github Actions.

Testing environment:
- Windows 7 SP1 (with no other update installed)
- Windows 8.1 Update 3 (with no other update installed)

### Go 1.21

- Windows 8.1 Update 3 / Windows Server 2012 R2: Can run official distributed Go SDK and binaries built from official SDK.
- Windows 7 SP1 / Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1:
  - Go 1.21rc1 ~ Go 1.21.4: Require update KB4474419 (SHA-2 code signing support update) installed. For computers that have Internet access, it is recommended to install KB4490628 (Servicing stack update) to install subsequent security update.
  - Go 1.21.5 and onward: Cannot run official distributed SDK or binaries built from official SDK, because of a change of crypto API in SDK.

### Go 1.22

- Windows 8.1 Update 3 / Windows Server 2012 R2: Can run official distributed Go SDK and binaries built from official SDK.
- Windows 7 SP1 / Windows Server 2008 R2: Require patches in SDK, and binaries must be built with patched SDK.
